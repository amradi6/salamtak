Hello everyone,
Today I will talk about my university major: Informatics Engineering.
I study at Latakia University, in the Faculty of Informatics Engineering.

Informatics Engineering is about computers, programming, and technology
We learn how to build programs, solve problems, and work with data.

In the fourth year, we choose one of three specializations:
1.Software Engineering:
We learn how to write programs and make software
We use programming languages like Python or Java

2. Artificial Intelligence:
We study smart systems like robots, voice assistants, and face recognition

3.Networks:
We learn about the internet, how computers talk to each other, and how to keep data safe

I like solving problems and creating programs.
Software Engineering helps me build useful apps and websites.
In the future, I want to be a software developer

Informatics Engineering is a great field for the future.
For me, Software Engineering is not just a subject.
It is a way of life. I am already a software engineer.
Thank you for listening!
